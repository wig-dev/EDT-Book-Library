## About

This is an API built in .NET9 as a solution to a coding challenge from EDT. I have spent just over 2 hours on this so I am submitting it with only one test case but have added a couple of actually useful tests that I would add next. 

I have written it as a Minimal API as I thought it would be right given the scope of the project. I also thought it would be interesting.
I have also thrown in .NET Aspire also as I thought it would be cool.

I have included a few simple API calls.

I have included one test case configured using the newer WebApplicationFactory rather than needing to use Mocks.

As this is .NET9 I have also showcased the use of OpenAPI for the API documentation generation as this has been added out of the box by Microsoft.
They have not added a UI so it still uses swaggerUI.


## Running the Application
Run the API project and navigate to /Swagger you can test the endpoints.

Run the test.

You can also set the EDT Book Library.AppHost as startup and run that if you want to run it with Aspire.
